# SPS Now

SPS Now is an all-in-one place for students to stay up-to-date with latest updates at SPS. Designed for St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire ([sps.edu](https://sps.edu))

### Try it out now at <ins>[spsnow.henhen1227.com](https://spsnow.henhen1227.com)</ins>

## Features

 - Customizable Class Calendar that stays up to date with the latest changes and holidays.
 - Club and Events database that allows students to send notifications about the latest happenings at SPS.
 - Up-to-date school menu system that allows students to see what is being served in the Coit Dining Hall and at Grab & Go.

## The SPS Now App

SPS Now is also available as an iOS app.
The app isn't updated as frequently as the website and is currently a couple versions behind.

Download the app [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sps-now/id6464536749).

## Backend Server/Database

The backend server is also open source
and can be found [https://github.com/hen1227/calendar-backend](https://github.com/hen1227/calendar-backend).

The database and backend server are both hosted on the Henhen1227 servers. 
Precautions have been taken to ensure the security of the database and server,
but I cannot guarantee the safety of the data.

Method of loading live calendar updates from Google Calendar's API was found by **Jack Rubiralta** '25.

Come by the Computer Science Club meetings on Tuesdays at 7:00 - 8:00 pm in Friedman Projects room 111 to learn how to get involved.

I'd love to hear any suggestions or feedback you have about the project. Please email me at <henry.abrahamsen@sps.edu> or <henhen1227@gmail>

## Funding

This project is currently running on the Henhen1227 servers. 

To fund this project, please consider donating [here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/henryabrahamsen/membership). 

I've been eyeing the domain **SPSNow.app** which costs $30 USD per year.
If interest is high enough, or if I get enough donations, I will purchase the domain and move the project over to it.


## Maintenance

I will graduate soon, so I'm hoping the Computer Science Club will continue to maintain this project.
